# Hacking-with-python-code
The following python scripts are used in Pentesting to test the target machine ports and bruteforce information. 
I have created these scripts for my own testing purposes.

>> ftpcon.py - This script will check for the anonymous login in the target's  machine. 

>>pxsshpy.py - This script is a simple demonstration of pxssh library. In this code the scripts takes target address,username and password and make ssh connection with the target.

>>scanandsearch.py - This script is a simple script which scan for only essential ports and check if they are open. 

>>ftpc.py - This script is ftp bruteforcing script. 

>>sshrbruter.py - This script is used to brute force username and password in SSH port.

>>sshpy.py - This script is the demonstration of usage of paramiko library in python.
